Meeting Notes
Date: October 1, 2025

Participants: Maya, Afia, Lauren

Agenda: 
1. The team discussed which tasks to prioritize based on recent learning progress.

2. The repository owner Maya  created a new task list for the group.

3. Since the team recently learned about data automation using crontab, the group decided to start with implementing that task.

4. One team member Afia took responsibility for setting up the automated data collection system.


Action Points:

1. The assigned team member Afia executed the data automation task successfully immediately.

2. The automation script is now running daily at midnight and collecting data from the provided link as intended.

Next steps:

Monitor the log file for consistency and errors.
Next step is based on the class materials, so we are waiting for that.

Meeting Notes
Date: October 28, 2025

Participants: Maya, Afia, Lauren

Agenda:

The team explored the existing Dash code to experiment with data visualization.

Each member worked on collecting data in CSV files to test visualizations using different data columns.

The goal was to understand how varying data inputs affect visualization outcomes.

Action Points:

All team members successfully created and tested different visualizations using their respective CSV datasets.

The exercise helped strengthen the team’s understanding of Dash and data manipulation.

Next Steps:

The team will wait to begin the SQL lessons before proceeding to the group assignment in full.

Continue exploring additional visualization options to refine the project setup.

Meeting Notes
Date: November 6, 2025

Participants: Maya, Afia, Lauren

Agenda:

The team installed SQL as part of setting up the next phase of the project.

During the session, all members encountered issues running the SQL code. The team discussed possible causes and began troubleshooting to identify and resolve the problem.

The overall goal remains to create a functional SQL data pipeline that will support the development of a project dashboard.

Action Points:

All members successfully installed SQL but faced similar errors when attempting to run the code.

The team collaborated to review setup steps and compare configurations to locate the root of the issue.

Next Steps:

Continue troubleshooting SQL runtime issues until resolved.

Once the issue is fixed, proceed to build the SQL data pipeline to generate data for the dashboard.

Note Taker: Afia.


Meeting Notes
Date: November 11, 2025

Participants: Maya, Afia, Lauren

Agenda:

The team met to review progress on the SQL setup and data pipeline.
Since the last session, all SQL issues were successfully resolved. Afia has completed the creation of the SQL database pipeline, which now serves as the foundation for the project’s data flow.

Maya is currently working on the presentation component, and both Maya and Lauren will provide the Flask API and Dash code for Afia to test and integrate with the SQL data.

Action Points:

SQL setup and runtime issues have been fully resolved.

Afia completed the SQL database pipeline and verified its functionality.

Maya is preparing the project presentation.

Maya and Lauren will share the Flask API and Dash code with Afia for integration testing.

Next Steps:

Afia will test the Flask API and Dash code once provided.

The team will integrate all components to build the full data dashboard.

Maya will continue developing the presentation for project review.

Meeting Notes
Date: November 18, 2025

Participants: Maya, Afia, Lauren

Agenda:

The team met to review the continued progress on the dashboard development, presentation materials, and system architecture.

Maya has already begun working on the presentation slides. Afia shared a draft sketch of the overall system architecture, and Maya will refine and finalize it on the slides, making additional adjustments as needed.

Lauren provided the Flask and Dash code required for the dashboard visualizations. Afia successfully implemented the code, and everything is functioning as expected. The team agreed that additional components—such as regression output and other analytical features—may be added to the dashboard as the project evolves. Overall, the project remains on schedule.

Action Points:

Maya started developing the presentation slides.

Afia provided the initial architecture sketch for the project.

Maya will finalize the architecture diagram on the slides and incorporate any necessary enhancements.

Lauren delivered the Flask API and Dash code.

Afia implemented the provided code into the system, and it is currently working as intended.

The team may continue expanding the dashboard with new elements like regression output.

Next Steps:

Maya will continue building and refining the presentation for the project review.

The team will explore additional features to enhance the dashboard.

Afia will support ongoing integration and testing as new dashboard components are developed.
