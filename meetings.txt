Participants: Maya, Afia, Lauren

Agenda:

The team explored the existing Dash code to experiment with data visualization.

Each member worked on collecting data in CSV files to test visualizations using different data columns.

The goal was to understand how varying data inputs affect visualization outcomes.

Action Points:

All team members successfully created and tested different visualizations using their respective CSV datasets.

The exercise helped strengthen the team’s understanding of Dash and data manipulation.

Next Steps:

The team will wait to begin the SQL lessons before proceeding to the group assignment in full.

Agenda:

The team installed SQL as part of setting up the next phase of the project.
